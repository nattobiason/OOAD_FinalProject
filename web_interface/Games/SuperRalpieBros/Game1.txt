SUPER MARIO (SUPER RALPHIE??)
(so like super mario but with a buffalo and its like cu themed or something)

logistics
- 2D game
- different levels (aiming to create ~3)
- user starts at one end and attempt to make it to the finish line
- there are obsticales, platforms, coins/something to get more points, boxes
- user can "die" by either falling off frame or being hit by obsticales
- screen moves with user

components
- ralphie (object contorled by user)
- blocks (ground, platforms, places ralphie can stand)
- coins
- obsticlas: gaps on the ground, flameing fans, bad guy shooter (ram)
- (optional) boxes (hit with head to get power up)
- (optional) power ups

user controls
- up arrow: jump
- left/right arrow: move horizonatllu
- down arrow: shrink/become shorter/dive


technical concepts
- OOP will be used in game logic 
- phaser used for game graphics
- gamepad api ??
