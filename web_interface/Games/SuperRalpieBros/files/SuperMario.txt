SUPER MARIO (SUPER RALPHIE??)
(so like super mario but with a buffalo and its like cu themed or something)

logistics
- 2D game
- different levels (aiming to create ~3)
- user starts at one end and attempt to make it to the finish line
- there are obsticales, platforms, coins/something to get more points, boxes
- user can "die" by either falling off frame or being hit by obsticales
- screen moves with user

components
- ralphie (object contorled by user)
- blocks (ground, platforms, places ralphie can stand)
- coins
- obsticlas: cliffs, spinning flameing fans, bad guy shooter, ram (mushroom)
- (optional) boxes (hit with head to get power up)
- (optional) power ups

user controls
- up arrow: jump
- left/right arrow: move horizonatlly
- down arrow: shrink/become shorter/dive


technical concepts
- OOP will be used in game logic 
- phaser used for game graphics
- gamepad api ??



TO-DO:
- points: 200 for stomping on mushroom, 100 for coins
- chance boxes
- life mushrooms
- bad guy mushroom
- points, lives, level at top of screen

last priority:
- disallow double jumping
- star power
- turtle bad guy
- shooter bad guy
- down arrow to shrink
